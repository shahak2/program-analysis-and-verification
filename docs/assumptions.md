### Simplifying assumptions: ###

1. The only one node with no incoming edges is the one from which the execution starts.
2. Every node in the control flow graph has at most two out-going edges.
3. If a node has more than one outgoing edges than these edges are annotated with assume commands.
4. Programs are syntactically legal, i.e., there is no need to handle syntax errors.


### Added assumptions: ###

1. L0 is always the entry label
